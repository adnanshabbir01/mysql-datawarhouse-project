# mysql-datawarhouse-project
This is a data engineering project focused on building a modern data warehouse using MySQL. I'm consolidating Excel exports from our CRM and ERP systems into a structured MySQL database. The goal is to transform scattered operational data into a centralized, queryable format to support reporting, analysis, and data-driven decision-making.
